# Userscripts

## [Dowload Twitter Videos](src/download-twitter-videos.user.ts)

Get it on [openuserjs.org](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/scambier/Dowload_Twitter_Videos) or [greasyfork.org](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/382640-twitter-video-download)

Hover your mouse over the videos and gifs to show a download button in their corner

Gifs are directly accessible, but videos will redirect you to one of the following tools:

- twdownload.com
- twittervideodownloader.com
- savetweetvid.com

**It will automatically fill the form and submit it.** You'll still have to pick the desired resolution :)

This script is _NOT_ affiliated with these sites.

## What are userscripts, and how to install them

Userscripts are kind of micro-addons for your browser. They're typically simple JavaScript files that are automatically executed on specific site, to alter their behavior or appearance.

They are managed with a "real" add-on, usually [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox, and [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chromium-based browsers.
